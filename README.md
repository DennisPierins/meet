# meet

meet is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. 
The users can filter events by location, change the number of displayed events, view/hide event details and see event details on Google Calendar.
